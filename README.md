***Home Buttons*** lets you control you smart home in a simple and intuitive way.  
With a couple of push buttons, you can set scenes, control lights, trigger automations, and more.

The device features an e-paper display that shows a label for each button. So you always know what it does!  
All while consuming next to no power.

The labels and button actions can be easily configured directly in *Home Assistant*.

*Home Buttons* communicates via the MQTT protocol on a local network. No cloud required.

> It's also possible to use *Home Buttons* without *Home Assistant*. It can be integrated into most smart home systems that support MQTT, though some features may not be available.
