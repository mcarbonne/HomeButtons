## How It Works

![How It Works](assets/promo_6.gif){align=left width="400"}

***Home Buttons*** lets you control you smart home in a simple and intuitive way. With a couple of push buttons, you can set scenes, control lights, trigger automations, and more.

You can set a label for each button, so you always know what it does. The labels are shown on an e-paper display, making them easily changeable as your smart home evolves. All while consuming next to no power.

The labels can be changed directly in *Home Assistant*. The same is true for setting up button actions.

*Home Buttons* communicates with *Home Assistant* via the MQTT protocol on a local network. No cloud required.

> It's also possible to use *Home Buttons* without *Home Assistant*. It can be integrated into most smart home systems that support MQTT, though some features may not be available.
